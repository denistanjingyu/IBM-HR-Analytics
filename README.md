A HR department receives thousands of resumes on a daily basis and evaluates them manually to shortlist candidates for a first-round interview. This is done by assessing if candidates have the right skills and experience, as well as the key qualities and traits required for a position. 
These various processes are currently very labor-intensive and hence, there is room to improve the effectiveness of current processes given the high turnover for certain roles such as sales. Also, it is difficult to accurately predict the potential fit and future conduct of the candidate. HR is thus seeking for ways to better support its HR team to make the recruitment process more effective with improved accuracy in the matching process. 
How might we leverage external data and non-traditional methods to accurately assess and shortlist candidates with the relevant skillsets, experience and psycho-emotional traits, or match them with relevant job openings to drive operational efficiency and improve accuracy in the matching process? 
 
Your team will propose and present your solution to the HR Dept.
